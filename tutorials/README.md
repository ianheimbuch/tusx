## Skull Masks
There are many ways to create skull masks. Regardless of which you choose, it is critical that you take care to make sure they are accurate, as the skull mask will have a massive impact on your acoustic simulation's results. If using an automated method, masks should be quality controlled and hand corrected for portions of the skull that will interact with the acoustic waves.
